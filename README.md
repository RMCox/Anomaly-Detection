# Anomaly-Detection

[Anomaly Detection Report PDF](https://github.com/RMCox/Anomaly-Detection/blob/main/Anomaly%20Detection%20in%20Cybersecurity%20Data.pdf)

Built a Streamlit dashboard for Anomaly Detection in DNS logs. Identified 2 kinds of anomaly; Time intervals with anomalous values for key features and Items which exhibit symptoms of DNS exploits  

* Implemented Autoencoders and Median Absolute Deviation for Anomaly Detection.  
* Assessed the strengths and weaknesses of various outlier detection methods.  
* Engineered features that would capture the symptoms of certain DNS exploits (Botnet Heatbeats, DNS Tunnelling, DDoS Attacks, Domain Flux).
* Implemented a risk-scoring system for the engineered features, similar to providers such as Splunk.
* Built the Anomaly Detection Solution Into a Dashbaord which allowed for Custom Anomaly Detection Checks, Neural Network Retraining and the Exporting of Results
