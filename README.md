# Anomaly-Detection

[Anomaly Detection Report PDF](https://github.com/RMCox/Anomaly-Detection/blob/main/Anomaly%20Detection%20in%20Cybersecurity%20Data.pdf)

Built a Streamlit dashboard for Anomaly Detection in DNS logs. Identified 2 kinds of anomaly; Time intervals with anomalous values for key features and Items which exhibit symptoms of DNS exploits  

* Implemented Autoencoders for outlier detection (and Median Absolute Deviation for static features).  
* Assessed the strengths and weaknesses of various outlier detection methods, such as robustness.  
* Engineered features that would capture the symptoms of certain DNS exploits (Botnet Heatbeats, DNS Tunnelling, DDoS Attacks, Domain Flux).  
* Implemented a risk-scoring system for these features, similar to providers such as Splunk.  
* Allowed for custom anomaly detection checks within the dashboard, specifying the desired method and time-interval  
* Allowed for retraining of neural networks within the dashboard  
* Allowed for the exporting of anomalies within the dashboard as a csv
